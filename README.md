# [JSL03] Project Submission: Which one is which? Declarative or Imperative?!

Loom Recording Link: [Insert Link]

# Project Overview

In this project, you will be presented with two JavaScript code examples, each demonstrating a different programming paradigm: imperative and declarative. Your task is to analyse these examples and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style.

You will present your reasoning for each example, record your presentation using Loom, and submit your findings along with the Loom recording to the Project Tab on the Learning Management System (LMS).

Examine each code example and determine which one follows an imperative programming style and which one follows a declarative programming style.

# Presentation Talking Points

Example #: [2]

## Imperative Approach [2 Minutes]

1. **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

- The imperative approach involves explicitly detailing each step of the cooking process within the code.
- The code defines specific actions such as preheating the grill, seasoning the steak, cooking it to the desired doneness, and serving it.
- Variables like grillTemperatureCelsius, seasoning, and cookingProcess are used to store and represent relevant information and actions in the process.

2. **Emphasis on How:**

- The focus of imperative programming is on "how" the work is completed as opposed to just "what" needs to be done.
- To carry out each action in turn, it makes use of building blocks including conditionals (switch statement), loops (for loop), and explicit instructions.
- Variables that are subject to change during the process, such step.temperature and step.desiredDoneness, are adjusted to reflect the steak's current cooking status.

## Declarative Approach [2 Minutes]

1. **High-Level Process Description:** High-Level Description of the Process:

- The code divides the cooking procedure into four primary parts in the declarative approach: setting the grill to warm, seasoning the meat, cooking it, and serving it.
- The code provides a higher-level perspective of the process by specifying what should happen at each stage of cooking the steak, rather than going into detail about how each step should be implemented.
- The code is easier to read and maintain since the steps are defined in a more abstract way, which also helps to isolate issues.

2. **Use of Data Structures:** Discuss the use of data structures (e.g., arrays, objects) to represent the process steps.

- The declarative method represents the cooking process using conditionals and straightforward variable assignments.
- Grill and steak status data is stored in data structures such as variables (grillTemperature, steakTemperature).
- A while loop is used in the code to abstract the cooking process, iterating until the steak is cooked to the appropriate doneness temperature.
- To encapsulate tasks like preheating the grill, seasoning the steak, and figuring out whether it's ready to serve, abstraction layers are provided using variable assignments and conditionals.

# Learning Outcome [1 Minute]

- Reflect on what you've learned from analyzing these code examples in different paradigms.
